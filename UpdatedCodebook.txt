# CodeBook for Transformed Data
## This is a CodeBook that explains what transformations have been done to the data to try and comply with the course projects instructions.
## Read the README first!
================================================================================================

PART I
Opening the File
================

Input the following command in R. Make sure you are using the correct file paths an directories, eitherwise it will not work.

file.edit("run_analysis.R")
setwd() ## Use these commands to navigate through your directories.
getwd()

These actions open up the R script with the commands to read the original data into R and perform transformations so as to get to two tables:
 * "tidy" -> The tidy dataset (columns are variables, rows are observations, insides are values). DataFrame of 10299 Obs. and 89 variables.
 * "tidyfinal" -> A recasted "tidy", with the average of the previous variables as values, plotted against rows of each subject by each activity.

PART II
What the script Does
=====================

subject: 1 through 30, identifies the subject with a number.
activity: string variable with descriptive name of one of six activities performed by subjects.
mean: mathematical average.
std: standard deviation.
t: denotes time
f/freq: denotes frequency
X,Y,Z: signifies which one of the three directions in a 3D plane the movement has been measured.
Acc: movement recorded by the accelerometer.
Gyro: movement recorded by the gyroscope.
BodyAcc: rate of change of velocity of a given body.
GravityAcc: rate of change of velocity caused by gravity.
Jerk: rate of change of acceleration.
Mag: magnitude calculated using the euclidean norm.
angle(): sample measurments of a given variable.

All values have been normalised to remove units of measurement and make them comparable. Thus, values range from (-1,+1) implying the magnitude of the movement.

The variables (features in the original data) are the following:
